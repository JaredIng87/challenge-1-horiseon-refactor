# challenge-1-horiseon-refactor

##Description

In this project I refactored source code for Horiseon Social Solution Services,Inc. Changes include replacing div's with semantic html tags, consolidating css groupings, and debugging to ensure all nav buttons function properly. These changes are intended to maintain functional webpage while creating a more managable line of code.
